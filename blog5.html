            <p>Artificial Intelligence is no longer a distant idea in the education sector. From intelligent tutoring systems to AI-driven content creation and personalized feedback, the classroom is evolving rapidly.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Personalized Learning</h3>
            <p>AI enables tailored learning paths for each student based on their pace, preferences, and performance—enhancing student engagement and outcomes.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Intelligent Feedback Systems</h3>
            <p>AI tools now give real-time feedback on essays, quizzes, and even programming assignments, allowing educators to focus on mentoring rather than grading.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Accessibility & Inclusivity</h3>
            <p>From automatic transcription to speech-to-text support and learning disability assistance, AI is making education more inclusive than ever.</p>

            <h3>4. Challenges & Ethical Concerns</h3>
            <p>Despite its benefits, AI in education must navigate data privacy, bias in algorithms, and over-reliance on automation. Human oversight remains essential.</p>

            <p>AI is a tool—not a replacement for teachers. When used wisely, it can revolutionize how we learn and teach across the globe.</p>
